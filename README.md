# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
Chain Messenger is a decentralized messaging application built on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to send messages to each other without the need for a centralized server. The messages are stored on the blockchain and can be accessed by anyone with the address of the sender and receiver. The dApp is built using the Ethereum blockchain, Solidity, and Next/React.
